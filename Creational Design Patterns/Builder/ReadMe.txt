Builder Design Pattern:
- Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- Pattern used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects.
- Creation of these aprts is independent of the main object.
- Hide the creation of the parts from the client so both aren't dependent.
- The builder knows the specifics & nobody else does.
