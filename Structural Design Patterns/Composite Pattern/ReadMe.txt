Composite Pattern:
- A partitioning design pattern
- Describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.

The Composite Pattern has four participants:

Component – Component declares the interface for objects in the composition and for accessing and managing its child components.
Leaf – Leaf defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition. It represents leaf objects in the composition.
Composite – Composite stores child components and implements child related operations in the component interface.
Client – Client manipulates the objects in the composition through the component interface.
